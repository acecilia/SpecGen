# SpecGen
SpecGen is a command line tool written in Swift that generates `.podspec` files from frameworks, with the goal of consumming them in a [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) setup.

* ðŸ‘Œ Generates `.podspec` files from `.framework` files
* ðŸ‘Œ[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) compatibility, so the generated `.podspec` files contain the version specified in the `Carfile.resolved` (effectively delegating to Carthage the dependency resolution)
* ðŸ˜‚ Massively reduce build times by substituting source code pods with their `.framework`
* ðŸ‘Œ Improve Xcode speed and responsiveness by substituting source code pods with their `.framework`
* ðŸ’¥ Use CocoaPods and Carthage together, allowing pods to depend on frameworks installed by Carthage
